```

The result from the period 1988-2017 shows that the relative (college/high school) supply has a negative impact on the relative (college/high school) wage ratio. This is in stark contrast to the result from the earlier period (1963-1987), which indicates that the relative supply has a positive and significant impact on the relative wage ratio.



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
